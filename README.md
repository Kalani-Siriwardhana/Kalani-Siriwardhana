### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kalani from Sri Lanka and I am a Physical Science graduate who is a Self- Learner in Data Science and Sports analytics. Through my experiences as an athelete I have developed a strong passion for the intersection of data science and sports. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in sports analytics and 
Sports performance analysis. I believe that my statistical, computational, and analytical skills will allow me to
effectively analyze and interpret data related to athlete performance, injury prevention, training
optimization, and sports strategy.
